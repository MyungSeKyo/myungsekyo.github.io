## agree

Since human being came out in this world, the importance of extended family was obvious. However, The type of family is not as imperative now as before. The reasons are that the current industries does not need as much manpower as before and the telecomunication technology have been evoloved very well.

To begin with, The major industry in the past was agriculture But now the major is IT industry. when the major is agriculture, people had to live together and need concentrated manpower to cultivate theif crops. I heard from my grandfather that when he was young, all their family members have to work together to cultivate crops. At that time, the big number of family member is very imperative. But, now, the most cultivations these days are done by minor people who are in agriculture industry and it is automated with machines. So, it needs little manpower.

On top of that, now, people don't care how far their family members are living. Because, we can keep in contact anyone no matther how far they are. The development of mobile telecommunication and world wide web makes this convenience possible. For example, I am not worry about my friends or family members when they are in an abroad trip. Because I can check how they enjoy the trip whenever I want with the social network services. Even though they don't upload their posting or picture, I can know what they do now by calling them.

To sum up, Now, People don't need to live together with their famliy as they used to do. Because, we don't need concentrated manpower anymore as before with the change of industry structure and we can keep contact with our family member with remote communication technology. Even though, they are living in another contry. In this regard, the extended family is not as important now as before
