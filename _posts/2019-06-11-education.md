## agree
### 1. sports promote physical health
- The modern life style is hamrful to health so sports can resolve that problem
- ex) I had backbone problem but overcome with sports
### 2. sports teach teamworks
- teamworking is very important in job. sports can teach that.
- ex) my little bro became confident in making friends.

Many people think that the most important thing in the university is academics. So some universities ignore the importance of sports. However, in my opinion, Universities should not overlook the necessity of sports.
First of all, Sports help students to keep healthy and energetic. University students have to spend a great deal of time on a desk with fixed posture. It can be generate bone problems. But playing sports regulary can resolve this problem. For example, I had had hard time with my backbone problem because of sedentary life style since I was a high school student. After I became a university student, I have joined the marathon club. I run regulary with my club members and overcome the backbone problem.
Second, Companies prefer a student who makes others feel to work together rather than who only knows many things in academics. Sports can be a good teacher for students to learn teamwork and social relationship. For instance, My little brother was very shy and introverted. But after entered the sccocer club. He became extroverted and had leadership a lot. Once he became confident in making new friends, then he got a self-confidence.
To sum up, Sports is very imperative because it can make students healthy and socialized. So universities should concentrate on sports as much as on libraries.
