title: "The fewer possessions you have, the happier you will be."
---

As everything in life is like a coin that has two different sides, people must weigh the pros and cons before jumping into conclusions. After all, each and every question or topic requires careful deliberation in that there are always multiple variables to a truth. Even though adamantly believe that the fewer possessions you have, the happier you will be, I strongly think such opinion lacks coherence to some extent. In my humble opinion, it is nothing short of impossible to say that money can guarantee some extent of happiness for the following reasons.

First and foremost, the majority of individuals would agree with the notion that the money can make you have much more time. In other words, if you have enough possessions, you don’t need to waste your time for earning money for living. In addition, the money can liberate you from caring how to sustain living. A great example is one of my friends. He was caring how to live and what to do for living. Meanwhiles, he found out his ability for stock trading and he became wealth. Now, he uses most of his time for himself because of his enough possessions. He never dreamed it before because of the money. All in all, we can’t and shouldn’t overlook the fact that money can make you free to some extent. 

On top of this, enough possessions can make you to avoid unhappiness which occurs when you don’t have minimum possessions. In other words, you can’t be happy without the minimum amount of food, a house you can take a rest and clothing which protects you from harsh weather. For example, in our capitalism society, with some exaggeration, you can never do anything you want. You can never go a fancy restaurant. You may not even dream of proper wedding ceremony with your bae. It would be pathetic.

In summation, yes, it is virtually impossible to provide a completely satisfying answer to an open-ended question. Although the jury may be out on this given essay topic, we can come to a mutual agreement that without possessions we cannot guarantee minimum happiness due to the reasons details mentioned above.
