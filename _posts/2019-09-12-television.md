title: "In order to encourage children to study harder, parents should avoid letting them watch television. "

As everything in life is like a coin that has two different sides, people must weigh the pros and cons before jumping into conclusions. After all, each and every question or topic requires careful deliberation in that there are always multiple variables to a truth. Even though some may adamantly believe that television is really detrimental to children and interfere them concentrating academics, I strongly think such opinion lacks coherence to some extent. In my humble opinion, watching television can be helpful to students for the following reasons.

First and foremost, children can learn about the world and acquire many insights for current issue. The main reason behind this rationale is that we can’t experience everything in the world. So, indirect experience is so imperative. Television can be a good source of indirect experiences. There is nothing we can’t learn from television. For example, when I was a child, I was interested in Japanese cultures and language. I was so fascinated with Japanese anime. I could acquire many common senses in such cultural media. As a result, I decided to go Japan as an exchange student in university where I made many Japanese friends with the common senses I got from animations.

On top of this, interfering children on everything is not rational when it comes to making a good relationship with one’s children. It rather makes children have bad attitude on what parents say. Some extent of freedom is essential to make a good ego. In other words, it is very personal thing such as computer games, watching TV, and so on. As parents force not to do something, children tend to have bad attitude. For example, when I was a high school student, I really fell into playing drums. However, my parents didn’t allow me to do that because it makes me hard to concentrate on academics, which rather makes me more fascinated on drums.

In summation, television can be a good source to educate children about the world. Allowing children to do what they want is really good for making good ego
